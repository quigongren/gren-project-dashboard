# Gren Family Lineage — Master Research Plan & Data Intake (v2)

## Data Intake — Confirmed Core Lineage (2025‑10‑16)

**Proband (Research Focus)**  
- **Name:** Carl John Gren  
- **Notes:** Second bearer of the name after paternal grandfather **Karl John Gren** (variant spelling: Karl/Carl).  
- **Parents:** Dennis Gren (father) and Jill (adopted in Illinois) Gren (mother).  

**Parents**  
- **Father:** Dennis Gren — **Birth:** March 28 1946.  
- **Mother:** Jill Gren — **Birth:** August 31 1945.  
  - **Adoptive parents:** Victor Frary (father) and Mary Frary (mother).  
  - **Birth parents:** [Unknown; adoption record research required].  

**Grandparents**  
- **Paternal:** Karl John Gren and Marie Gren (maiden name TBD).  
- **Maternal (Adoptive):** Victor Frary and Mary Frary.  

**Surnames of Interest:** Gren, Frary.  

**Immediate Research Priorities**  
1. Locate birthplaces and marriage record for **Dennis & Jill Gren**.  
2. Confirm marriage and maiden name for **Marie Gren**.  
3. Identify residences and death dates for **Karl & Marie Gren**.  
4. Gather obituaries and vital records for **Victor & Mary Frary** (to reveal maiden names and origins).  
5. Investigate **Jill Gren’s adoption**—state, agency, and possible birth surname.

**Initial Hypotheses**  
- The Gren family may have Scandinavian origins (name form *Gren* and variant *Grenn* common in Sweden/Norway).  
- Frary surname indicates Anglo‑Norman or early New England colonial lineage; possibly tied to mid‑Atlantic or New England migration streams.  
- Jill’s adoption in 1945‑46 suggests wartime/post‑WWII context—potential hospital or church‑based placement; jurisdiction likely Illinois or Tennessee pending confirmation.  

**Next Actions**  
- Create surname × locality × timeframe matrix for **Gren** and **Frary**.  
- Search Social Security Death Index and local obituaries for **Karl, Marie, Victor,** and **Mary**.  
- Query 1950 U.S. Census for **Dennis Gren (b. 1946)** household to identify parental residence.  
- Begin request outline for Jill’s adoption non‑identifying information from the relevant state agency.

## Working Notes

This v2 update consolidates the core lineage data supplied by the user and sets clear first‑round research objectives. Once additional geographic details (birthplaces, residences) are provided, searches can be launched in census, vital, and military record repositories.


---

## Geographic Scope & Triangulation Matrix (U.S. 48 + Alaska + Canada/Nova Scotia)

**Scope.** Expand systematic searches to the contiguous United States, **Alaska**, and **Canada** (with emphasis on **Nova Scotia**). We will triangulate identity across jurisdictions by correlating censuses, vital records, border crossings, naturalizations, directories, land/probate, church registers, and newspapers.

**Triangulation Matrix (framework)**
- **Axis A — Surname/Person**: Gren, Frary, [others TBD]
- **Axis B — Jurisdiction**: US‑Federal; US‑State (IL, TN, AK, others as found); Canada‑Federal; Canada‑Provincial (NS, others TBD)
- **Axis C — Timeframe**: life‑event windows per person
- **Method**: For each person×place×time slice, log *Found*/*Not Found* results, extract addresses/associates (FAN), and propagate to adjacent jurisdictions.

**Key Record Sets & Repositories (shortcut list)**
- **United States (Federal)**: Censuses; military (NARA/NPRC); passports; naturalizations; border crossings (US‑Canada); immigration lists; Social Security (SSDI/Numident derivatives); BLM land patents; USGS GNIS for places.
- **Illinois & Tennessee (examples)**: State vital indexes/certificates; county clerk deeds/probate; city directories; local newspapers; church registers.
- **Alaska**: Territorial/state vital records; directories; land & mining claims; territorial censuses; military posts; newspapers.
- **Canada (Federal)**: National censuses; passenger lists; border entries; naturalizations; WWI/WWII service files; LAC collections.
- **Nova Scotia (Provincial)**: Vital statistics; parish registers; land records; probate; local newspapers; immigration via Halifax (incl. Pier 21 context); cemetery registers.

**Cross‑Border Strategies**
1) **Border Crossings (US↔Canada)**: Query St. Albans lists and Canadian border entry forms; align dates with passports/naturalizations.
2) **Naturalization Two‑Step**: If naturalized in Canada or the US, search both pre‑ and post‑naturalization residences; pull declarations, petitions, and certificates.
3) **Name Variants & Language**: Track *Gren/Grenn/Grahn* and *Frary/Frere/Frerey* variants; apply wildcarding and phonetic algorithms (Soundex/Daitch‑Mokotoff) across repositories.
4) **Maritime & Port Focus**: Check Halifax (Pier 21), Boston, New York, and Great Lakes ports; extend to Seattle/Vancouver if Alaska or Pacific routes appear.

**Output Add‑Ons**
- Cross‑border residence timeline charts
- Geo‑heatmaps of record hits by decade
- Branch dossiers when cross‑border events appear (immigration, service in Canadian or US forces, etc.)

1. Query by surname variant **Gren/Grenn/Grenn** and wildcard **Gr*n**.  
2. Filter by child’s age **3–5** and parents’ given names left blank; then scan for households with **Karl/Karl J./Marie**.

**Obituary & SSDI Sweep (Victor & Mary Frary):**
1. Search SSDI/transcribed death indexes for Frary with birth window 1900–1930 (adjust once ages are known).  
2. Pull matching obituaries via newspaper databases; extract maiden name, children, pallbearers, churches, lodges.  
3. Use details to jump to county probate indexes and cemetery records.

**Marriage‑to‑Maiden Strategy (Marie Gren):**
1. Look for children’s birth certificates and obituaries listing mother’s **maiden name**.

## DNA Ancestry & Genetic Profile — Marcus Gren

**Source:** AncestryDNA results (as provided by Marcus Gren)

**Ancestral Regions (%):**  
- Southern Germanic Europe — 23%  
- North Central Europe — 19%  
- West Midlands — 16%  
- Southeastern England & Northwestern Europe — 12%  
- Central Scotland & Northern Ireland — 9%  
- Western Ukraine — 6%  
- Slovenia — 3%  
- Quebec — 3%  
- Denmark — 2%  
- Northern Spain — 2%  
- Southern Wales — 2%  
- Munster, Ireland — 2%  
- The Netherlands — 1%  

**Ancestral Journeys:**  
- Eastern Ohio River Valley & Northern Blue Ridge Mountains Settlers  
- Southern Pennsylvania & Amish Country, Ohio Settlers  
- Southwestern Quebec French Settlers  
- Outaouais & Laurentides French Settlers  
- Rivière du Nord French Settlers  
- Virginia & Eastern Kentucky Settlers  
- Scott & Wise County, Virginia Settlers  
- Southwest Virginia Settlers  

**Interpretation & Context:**  
The Gren family’s genetic footprint shows a dominant North‑Central and Western European ancestry (Germanic + British Isles blend) consistent with historical immigration streams into the Upper Midwest.  

The French‑Canadian trace (Quebec/Outaouais settlers) suggests a potential ancestral link through early colonial intermarriage or migration into Great Lakes regions (common among Illinois settlers of the 18th–19th centuries).  

The British‑Isles segments (West Midlands, England; Scotland; Ireland; Wales) align with trans‑Atlantic migrations via Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky—routes noted in the Ancestry “Settler” clusters. These corridors fed later Midwestern movements into Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, supporting the family’s presence in Illinois by the mid‑20th century.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Cross‑reference DNA matches on Ancestry with surnames **Gren, Frary, Prince, Passmore**, and **Devenney**.  
2. Identify shared match clusters connected to Ohio River Valley, Virginia, or Quebec settlers.  
3. Integrate haplogroup or Y‑DNA/mtDNA data when available for deep‑time lineage tracing.
